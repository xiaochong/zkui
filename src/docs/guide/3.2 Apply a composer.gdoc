Each component Taglib has a @apply@ attitude,so you can place the composer here
{code:xml}
<z:window id="myWindowComposer" apply="package.WindowComposer">
    ...
</z:window>
{code}

In the WindowComposer side
{code}
def afterCompose = {Component comp ->
    assert comp.id=="myWindowComposer"
    assert (comp instanceof org.zkoss.zul.Window)
}
{code}
